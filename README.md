This repository provides a simplified approach to install MMDetection, designed for beginners to solve common environment configuration issues.

[‰∏≠Êñá](./README_zh.md) | English

## üåü Features

- ‚úÖ Pre-configured environment files, no need to solve dependency issues manually
- ‚úÖ Detailed step-by-step instructions for first-time users
- ‚úÖ Automated installation scripts for one-click setup
- ‚úÖ Avoids common errors and pitfalls

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8
- CUDA 11.8
- Sufficient disk space (at least 5GB)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you plan to use a different version (e.g., Python 3.10 or CUDA 12),  
> please manually align compatible versions of **PyTorch**, **MMCV**, and **MMEngine** to avoid conflicts.  
> Incompatible versions may cause installation issues or runtime errors.  
>
> ‚úÖ Recommended references:

## üöÄ Quick Installation

### Method 1: Using Conda (environment.yml) (Recommend)

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/easy-mmdetection-setup.git
cd easy-mmdetection-setup

# 2. Create and activate Conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mmdet

# 3. Verify installation
python verify_install.py
```

### Method 2: Using pip (requirements.txt)

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/easy-mmdetection-setup.git
cd easy-mmdetection-setup

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv mmdet_env
source mmdet_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
mmdet_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Verify installation
python verify_install.py
```

### Method 3: One-click Installation Script

```bash
# Linux/Mac
./install.sh

# Windows
install.bat
```

## üîç Verify Installation

After successful installation, run the following test:

```python
# Execute in Python
import mmdet
import torch

print(f"MMDetection version: {mmdet.__version__}")
print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
```

## üìù Getting Started Tutorial

After installation, check out MMdetection [Getting Started Guide](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html) to learn how to:

1. Run your first object detection
2. Use pre-trained models for inference
3. Train with your own dataset
4. See example code for common tasks

## ‚ùì Common Issues & Solutions

<details>
<summary>Getting "CUDA error: ..." during installation</summary>
This usually indicates that the PyTorch version doesn't match your CUDA version. Make sure to use a PyTorch build that matches your system's CUDA version. You can find compatible versions at the <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">PyTorch website</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary>ImportError: cannot import name 'XXXX' from 'mmdet'</summary>
This typically happens when MMCV and MMDetection versions are not compatible. Please ensure you're using our provided environment files where the versions have been tested for compatibility.
</details>
